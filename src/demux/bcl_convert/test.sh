# We are using the tiny bcl dataset provided by Illumina:
#   https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/mkfastq
# Unfortunately,
#   1. the sample sheet delivered with it does not work with bcl-convert (v1 of the format)
#   2. 2 filter files are missing from the run directory that bcl-convert requires to run
#
# We worked around this by
#   1. Manually editing a sample sheet file suited for bcl-convert (format v2)
#   2. Adding a filter file
#
# The filter file is a binary file, we just created an empty file use that.
# bcl-convert might complain about it, but at least something is written out.
# An alternative is to use a filter file from a different project. This also generates
# a warning, but the fastq ouput files contain reads. The drawback is that those filter files
# are generally above 100MB in size.
#
# TODO: Check if a (binary) filter file can be generated that is small but works.
