# Concat

Takes multiple single sample multi-modality muons (ss_muon) together and merges it into a single muon containing all samples. 

!!! What to merge here and what not. At the moment we use a field selector for the obs slots which we can specify what to keep and what not. I.e. what do you do when overwriting different fields etc.
